# Application

as a bootcamp student I would like to organise my GitHub folders and repositories to build a designer portfolio that is attractive to employers.

This application is in the development to design a page that combines scheduling and searching for the relevant information on internet.

The public benefit of the application is to support green activities around us.


## Resources

for this week of bootcamp activities I have used npm packages

    ### inquirer
    ### file system
    ### dayjs
